===========================
Add strains to the database
===========================

Next, you need to add your strain iteratively to the database.
A draft genome can be used (we recommend to use Spades for assembly).
You can also add reference genome for comparison.


Get the Source
==============

The source code for the `PyMLST` project lives at
`github <https://github.com/bvalot/pyMLST.git>`_.  
You can use `git clone` to get it.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/bvalot/pyMLST.git
